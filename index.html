											<h2>So-Called "Scientists"</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Before we get started, I'd like to let our readers know that <b>every</b> scientist in the world is a liar. Every single one of them is only in it for the money and do not care about letting us know the truth. I honestly cannot even imagine why any of you would trust them, like they're some kind of highly qualified genius or something. They've been lying to us since the "moon landing", but that's for another time. Our topic today is global warming. Let's begin!</p>

									<h2>Global Warming and Its Many Benefits</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I'm sure that most of you know what global warming is. In simple terms, it is the slow steady rise in Earth's surface temperature. What most of you <i>don't</i> know is that global warming is not bad at all. Recently, scientists and politicians have been fearmongering the citizens of the world with the supposed threats that global warming brings or will bring. Well, these people are twisting the facts to benefit themselves. The 'threats' of global warming will actually make our planet much better! One effect of global warming that scientists are claiming will destroy our planet is the melting of the ice caps. When the ice caps melt, the sea level will rise dramatically. A lot of animals will die, but it's not our fault that they didn't just get away from the water. The shore will move farther inland which means that everyone is now closer to the beach, and who doesn't love the beach? Global warming will also make the average temperature go up. That means that we won't have to pay money for heat in our homes, saving us a lot of money. Thousands more people will die from heat-related problems every year, but who cares when we're saving money! Use that extra money to go see a doctor! If you're too hot just turn your AC on. With global warming, millions of animals will eventually die, which is obviously a good thing. Many of the animals that will die are probably dangerous which will make our world safer to live in, and it will leave more fruits and other food left for us to consume.

									<h2>Some Downsides to Global Warming</h2>
									<p>Although global warming is pretty much perfect, there are a few small things about it that aren't too great. Take a look:</p>
								</header>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">

										More and Stronger Hurricanes
									</li>
									<li class="style2">

										Increased Temperatures
									</li>
									<li class="style3">

										More Acidic Oceans
									</li>
									<li class="style4">

										Species Going Extinct
									</li>
									<li class="style5">

										Increased Death Rates
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="major">As you can see, there are several negative effects of global warming. The intensity, frequency, and duration of hurricanes will become longer greater. The planet will get hotter and hotter each year and the oceans will become more acidic from absorbing our excess emissions. Possibly hundreds of species of animals could go extinct because of the increased heat and their ecosystems being destroyed, and more humans will also die because of the heat. Despite these things, the good obviously outweighs the bad. Saving money, having closer beaches, and having more food is definitely a good tradeoff, right?</p>

									<h2>Our Conclusion</h2>
									<p>Hopefully from reading this, you now believe me when I say that you cannot trust those greedy scientists. They are lying to us for their own gain and are trying to hide the benefits of global warming from us. Sure, the world is slowly being destroyed and global warming will ruin billions of lives one day but who really cares when global warming will make all of our lives slightly better and most of us reading this probably won't even be alive by the time global warming gets too serious? Thanks for reading and come back next week for our article on the fake moon landings!</p>
